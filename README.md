> Although seemingly unremarkable in appearance, the utility belt is one of Batman's most important tools in fighting crime.


## About

Utility belt started at [EnjoyHQ](https://github.com/nomnom-insights/nomnom.utility-belt) as a way of sharing code that didn't belong anywhere else but was useful to have and use across services and libraries.

This fork carries on that tradition, but further reduces the scope so that it provides only zero-dependency code useful for building applications.
